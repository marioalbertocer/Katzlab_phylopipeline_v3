//
This file needs to reside in the Scripts folder of your Pipeline.
All parameters have a default value inside the script that runs the pipeline (e.g. phylopipe_3.py)
but if you want to make any changes, do it here.  Leve the parameter name and format (e.g. #blastCutOff)
of each line alone.  Only change the value.  Do not use quotes around values.
