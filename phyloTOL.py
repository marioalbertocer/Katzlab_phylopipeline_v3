	JG - Pipeline 3
	
	run Gene step - just up to guidance.
	To do this, I made a new pipeline method (two, actually) called 'test_keep' and 'test_remove'
	keep and remove are for ingroup paralogs, as I wasn't sure which you wanted.
	
	MACR - Pipeline 3
	
	Besides the changes described by Jessica above, there 3 major changes for pipeline 3:
	- A new Guidance method: This is a bash script made by Miguel Fonseca
	- A "helper" for the new Guidance method. This helper is a perl script that edits the intermediary
	files of each guidance run in order to allow the looping.
	- A new module called Utilities. I made this module to take the preguidance files and run Miguel's 
	scripts. Once Guidance and raxml are done. Some functions of the module allow to continue to produce the alignments
	for concatenation. Finally it organizes all output files.
	
	MACR - Pipeline 3.1

	- Neddle step and ingroup paralogs removal were replaced. Now we have an overlap filter (OF) and a similarity filter (SF). Both are performed using 
	Usearch-Ublast. We removed this step from the taxon class and added as a separated script called 'iterUblast.py'. This 
	script is called from the module 'Utilities'.
	
	The logic now is: All sequences per taxa should be 1.5 times smaller tha the average OG legth and pass the overlap filter. Then the user specify 
	if she/he wants to run a similarity filter for the sequences.
